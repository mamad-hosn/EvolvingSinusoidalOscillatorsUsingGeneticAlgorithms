# Evolving-Sinusoidal-Oscillators-Using-Genetic-Algorithms
I implemented(MATLAB) a paper on synthesizing single-opamp sinusoidal oscillators (SFOs) using genetic algorithms (GAs). The paper aimed to automate the design and analysis of SFOs using different active building blocks (ABBs), and to discover new topologies of oscillators. I used a novel fitness evaluation scheme based on the transfer function of the circuits, and a learning scheme inspired by Lamarckian search. I also tested a new problem-specific crossover operator and compared it with other operators. The results showed that the GA could rediscover all the known canonic SFOs using opamps, and also generate some new SFOs using other ABBs such as OTRA and DDCC. I explained how this study could be extended to other ABBs or multiple ABBs.
